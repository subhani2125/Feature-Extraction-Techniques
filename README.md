# Feature-Extraction-Techniques
 This repository focuses on feature extraction techniques applied to a dataset of gender-based names, aiming to improve the accuracy of machine learning models. The analysis leverages both manual and automated feature extraction methods to transform raw data into meaningful representations, enhancing model performance.  Manual Feature Extraction: Two domain-specific features were created:  Odd Length Names: A feature that categorizes names based on odd or even character counts. Vowel Position Analysis: A feature that identifies whether the second-last character in a name is a vowel, uncovering linguistic patterns. Automated Feature Extraction: Using Polynomial Feature Expansion, the dataset was transformed to include interaction terms, increasing its shape to (30, 6) and capturing complex relationships among features.
